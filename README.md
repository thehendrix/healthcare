# Healthcare Application

This is a healthcare management system application I found on YouTube channel JavaScript Mastery.
Trying to recreate this project while learning more about Next.js, Twilio, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Appwrite, and Shadcn/ui

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
